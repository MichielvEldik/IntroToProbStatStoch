## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{python}
def insertionSort(arr):
  for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    j = i
    while arr[j -1] > arr[j] and j > 0:
      arr[j -1], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[j-1]
      j -= 1
arr = [2, 4, 1, 3]
insertionSort(arr)
print(arr)
```
